⚽ Predicting Premier League Winner with Random Forest

This project applies machine learning to predict the Premier League winner using team performance statistics. I built a Random Forest Classifier in Python to analyse historical data and forecast the most likely champion based on early-season matches.

⚙️ Tools

Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

🚀 Highlights

1) Collected and cleaned Premier League data (2018–2026)
2) Trained and evaluated a Random Forest model for prediction
3) Visualised team win probabilities using Matplotlib and Seaborn
